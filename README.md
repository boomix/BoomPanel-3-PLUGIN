# BoomPanel-3-PLUGIN

## What is BoomPanel 3?
BoomPanel 3 is new kind of admin panel, with the big difference, where Vue.js + Websockets is based on frontend, and 
sourcemod/SRCDS server runs as backend for the panel. In short that means any already existing plugin creators easly can add 
support for this panel and have UI interface for their plugins. It also means you can have access to different kind of server 
command even not beeing in server. The panel is lightning fast and will mostly be managed by community itself.
